# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

Louise is interested in starting a crowdfunding campaign to help raise funds for a play she wants to put on. With existing crowdfunding data at our disposal, we were tasked with conducting an exploratory analysis to uncover hidden factors that may contribute to the likelihood of the success or failure of a crowdfunding campaign. 

## Analysis and Challenges

The data was initially prepared by splitting parent categories and subcategories in order to view how theater and play-related crowdfunding campaigns performed compared to other categories. Dates were also analyzed to determine the relationship between date of campaign launch and successful outcomes. The chart below ‘Theater outcomes based on Launch Date’ shows us that successful campaigns tend to launch sometime in May. The data also shows us that no campaigns were cancelled in October.

The data was then analyzed for possible relationships between campaign goal and the likelihood of a successful campaign. From the data, the “Outcomes based on Goals” chart was created. We can see that failed campaigns had a higher fundraising goal than successful ones. There were also observable trends of decline after $1k, $25k, and $45k as if donations did not usually occur in other than these standardized amounts.

There were no challenges or difficulties encountered during this project other than the limitations of the analyst and analyses not conducted due to said limitations. Data limitations include not having information on the backers that may or may not include their interests and donation frequency.

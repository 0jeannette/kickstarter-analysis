An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

Louise is interested in starting a crowdfunding campaign for her play, Fever. She tasked me with investigating if there are specific factors that contribute to a successful crowdfunding campaign. By analyzing existing crowdfunding data, I was able to provide Louise with several insights specific to theater crowdfunding campaigns since her goal is to eventually put on a play.

The kickstarter data was prepared by first splitting the ‘Category and Subcategory’ column into two separate columns (Parent Category and Subcategory) in order to view detailed outcomes (Successful, Failed, Live, Canceled) for all categories. The ‘Outcomes based on Parent Category’ graph below shows us how theater-related crowdfunding campaigns performed compared to other parent categories in the US:

To drill down even further, an ‘Outcomes based on Subcategories’ chart was created to in order to see how plays, specifically, fared compared to other subcategories. We can see the ratio between failed and successful crowdfunding campaigns for plays in the US:

Dates were analyzed to determine whether the length of a campaign makes a difference in determining success or if launching a campaign during a certain time of year will make it more successful. The chart below ‘Outcomes based on Launch Date’ shows us that successful campaigns tend to launch sometime in May. The trend does not change if US data is filtered out:

Additional statistical components were calculated for successful vs. failed campaigns. From the data, we can see that failed campaigns had a higher fundraising goal than successful ones.

Recommendations:
Louise should consider lowering her fundraising goal to an attainable figure based on figures used by successful campaigns. Further research might include investigating the cost of putting on a play like Fever in order to help Louise determine a more appropriate fundraising goal.
